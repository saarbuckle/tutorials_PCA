# Analyzing population dynamics (mostly with PCA)

This repository is for a set of two methods lunches held by myself and Dr. Marieke Mur at Western University. The first lunch covers the basics of principal component analysis (PCA). The second session covers a range of contemporary analysis techniques which use PCA to interpret/analyse neural population data (June 17). In both sessions, we aimed to have an even mix of math and intuition, using visualisations to aid understanding. 

The slides for both can be found under 'slides'.

The MATLAB example code is 'pca_lunch'. The function cases are meant to be modular so that you can play around with things to aid understanding.
